            Steps:
            1x1 convolution, to reduce the dimension, and pass less parameters to the subsequent(next) 
            layer fot it to learn less features. The output is a feature map with reduced dimensions(depth)

            3x3 convolution after 1x1 dimensionality reduction. As the previous one, 1x1 decreases the spatial 
            dimension, and focuses on more local variables. After 1x1, 3x3 convolution helps to focus on more 
            global variables. Output is another feature map,  capturing different aspects of the input.

            Similar to the 3x3 one, 5x5 convolution captures even more global points from the data after a 1x1 
            dimensionality reduction.

            Finally Max pooling to be able to extract the most important features from the data. 1x1 conv layer 
            refines the output of maxpool.
